## Overview

Project Sigmoid AI is designed to analyze transaction data and detect potential fraud by training machine learning models on historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface for real-time fraud detection. 🧠💡

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize transaction data to understand patterns and anomalies. 📊
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions. 🏋️‍♂️
- **Real-Time Detection**: Deploy models to identify fraud in real-time using a Streamlit application. ⏱️
- **Preprocessing Utilities**: Encode categorical variables and handle missing data efficiently. 🛠️

## Installation

To get started with Project Sigmoid AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielVrabie007/Project_Sigmoid_AI.git
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   For Windows:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   For Unix or MacOS:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the application using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

This will launch the web application where you can interact with the fraud detection system. 🌐

## Dataset

The project utilizes a credit card fraud detection dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:

[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

Please ensure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the application. 📂
